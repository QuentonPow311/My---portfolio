	  Directions:
		1. Create a DIV element to contain the page content.
		2. Inside your DIV, create an H1 tag that contains your name as the text.
		3. Below your H1 tag, create an H2 tag that contains the content text, "Software Developer."
		4. Below your H2 tag, create an HR tag, which will make a horizontal line.
		5. Create a paragraph tag and put a sentence of your choice in it. (Suggestion: "My favorite thing about programming is _______.")
		6. Create an H3 tag that says "My Projects."
		7. Create a paragraph tag that says "Coming Soon."
		8. Create an H3 tag that says "About Me."
		9. Create a paragraph tag that contains the "lorem ipsum" text. HINT: You will need to do a search for this text...it is long! Alternatively, grab a sample from this site: https://generator.lorem-ipsum.info/

		BONUS: Try one of the following ideas if you finish early.
		  - Switch out your lorem ipsum for Hipster Ipsum (https://hipsum.co/).
		  - Add another H3 that contains "Contact Me," a paragraph tag containing your email, and a paragraph tag containing your phone number (these can be fake!).

<p>Lorem ipsum is a pseudo-Latin text used in web design, typography, layout, and printing in place of English to emphasise design elements over content. 
    It's also called placeholder (or filler) text. It's a convenient tool for mock-ups. It helps to outline the visual elements of a document or presentation, eg typography, font, or layout.
     Lorem ipsum is mostly a part of a Latin text by the classical author and philosopher Cicero. 
    Its words and letters have been changed by addition or removal, so to deliberately render its content nonsensical; it's not genuine, correct, or comprehensible Latin anymore.
     While lorem ipsum's still resembles classical Latin, it actually has no meaning whatsoever. 
     As Cicero's text doesn't contain the letters K, W, or Z, alien to latin, these, and others are often inserted randomly to mimic the typographic appearence of European languages, as are digraphs not to be found in the original.
    In a professional context it often happens that private or corporate clients corder a publication to be made and presented with the actual content still not being ready. 
    Think of a news blog that's filled with content hourly on the day of going live. 
    However, reviewers tend to be distracted by comprehensible content, say, a random text copied from a newspaper or the internet. The are likely to focus on the text, disregarding the layout and its elements.
     Besides, random text risks to be unintendedly humorous or offensive, an unacceptable risk in corporate environments. Lorem ipsum and its many variants have been employed since the early 1960ies, and quite likely since the sixteenth century.
